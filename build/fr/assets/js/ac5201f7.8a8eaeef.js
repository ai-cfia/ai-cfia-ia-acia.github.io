Its success is achieved\\nthrough Canada\u2019s commitment to innovation and development of advanced\\ntechnologies, allowing for the delivery of high-quality products that meet both\\ninternational and domestic needs.\\n\\nNaturally, a collaboration between a research group from the Seed Science and\\nTechnology Section and the AI Lab of CFIA formed to maintain Canada\u2019s role as a\\nreputable leader in the global seed industry.\\n\\n### Background: Quality Control\\n\\nThe seed quality of a crop is reflected in a grading report, whereby the final\\ngrade reflects how well a seed lot conforms with Canada\u2019s Seeds Regulations to\\nmeet minimum quality standards. Factors used to determine crop quality include:\\npurity analysis and percent of seed germination and disease. The seed\u2019s\\ngermination rate and resistance to disease can provide insight into overall seed\\nhealth. Assessing content purity is essential in ensuring that the crop contains\\na high concentration of the desired seed material and that it is free from\\ncontaminants, such as other crop seeds or weed seeds. Seed inspection also plays\\nan important role in preventing the spread of prohibited and regulated species\\nlisted in the Canadian Weed Seeds Order.\\n\\n### Motivation\\n\\nPresently, the evaluation of a crop\u2019s quality is done manually by human experts.\\nHowever, this process is tedious and time consuming. At the AI Lab, we leverage\\nadvanced computer vision models to automatically classify seed species from\\nimages, rendering this process more efficient and reliable.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n## Overcoming limitations using Computer Vision\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<div style={{display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'space-between\'}}>\\n\\n<div style={{flex: 1, marginRight: \'10px\'}}>\\n\\n### Shortage of Analysts\\n\\n![3](./img/3.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div style={{flex: 2, marginRight: \'10px\'}}>\\n\\nThe shortage of expert seed analysts poses a significant challenge in the seed\\nindustry. The demand for accurate and efficient seed quality assessment is\\nincreasing, but the availability of highly trained analysts is limited. This\\nscarcity can lead to delays in turnaround time for quality assessments,\\nbottlenecks for seed trade, and potential errors in seed classification to\\nregulate species.\\n\\n#### How AI helps\\n\\nComputer vision presents a promising solution to overcome this shortage by\\neffectively analyzing and classifying seeds with minimal human intervention.\\nThese models can be trained on vast datasets of seed images, enabling them to\\nrecognize patterns, detect variations, and classify seeds based on predetermined\\nquality parameters. By adopting computer vision models in seed analysis,\\ncompanies and agricultural institutions can alleviate the burden of expert\\nshortages, streamline their operations, and enhance overall productivity. This\\ntechnology allows Canada to meet the growing demand for seed quality\\nassessments, leading to improved crop yields, reliable seed selection, and\\nultimately, sustainable agricultural practices.\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n---\\n\\n<div style={{display: \'flex\', justifyContent: \'space-between\'}}>\\n\\n<div style={{flex: 1, marginRight: \'10px\'}}>\\n\\n### Time limitations\\n\\n![4](./img/4.png)\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n<div style={{flex: 2, marginRight: \'10px\'}}>\\n\\nManual analysis of seeds is a time-consuming process that poses challenges in\\nterms of efficiency and speed. Seed classification is time-consuming due to the\\ncomplexity and volume of seed samples. Human experts require significant time\\nand effort to visually inspect and classify each seed, leading to bottlenecks\\nand potential delays in the quality control process.\\n\\n#### How AI helps (Time limitation)\\n\\nComputer vision models offer a solution to these bottlenecks by automating the\\nanalysis.

The\\nassociated costs and time required to train expert analysts include not only the\\ntraining programs but also the resources required for practical hands-on\\nexperience. The time it takes for analysts to gain the necessary proficiency and\\nexperience can be lengthy, further exacerbating the shortage of qualified\\nprofessionals.\\n\\n#### How AI helps (Cost)\\n\\nComputer vision models can offer a more scalable and efficient approach to seed\\nanalysis, mitigating the costs and time constraints associated with training\\nexpert analysts. Models can be trained on large datasets of seed images,\\neliminating the need for extensive human training. Additionally, computer vision\\nmodels can continuously learn and improve over time, rapidly adapting to new\\nseed varieties and enhancing their accuracy.

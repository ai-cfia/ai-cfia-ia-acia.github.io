through Canada’s commitment to innovation and development of advanced
technologies, allowing for the delivery of high-quality products that meet both
international and domestic needs.</p><p>Naturally, a collaboration between a research group from the Seed Science and

grade reflects how well a seed lot conforms with Canada’s Seeds Regulations to
meet minimum quality standards. Factors used to determine crop quality include:
purity analysis and percent of seed germination and disease. The seed’s
germination rate and resistance to disease can provide insight into overall seed
health. Assessing content purity is essential in ensuring that the crop contains
a high concentration of the desired seed material and that it is free from
contaminants, such as other crop seeds or weed seeds. Seed inspection also plays
an important role in preventing the spread of prohibited and regulated species
listed in the Canadian Weed Seeds Order.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="motivation">Motivation<a class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Motivation" title="Direct link to Motivation" href="https://ai-cfia-ia-acia.github.io/articles/seed-classification#motivation">​</a></h3><p>Presently, the evaluation of a crop’s quality is done manually by human experts.

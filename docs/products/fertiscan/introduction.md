# Introduction to FertiScan

## Context

FertiScan, developed by the AI Lab, aims to streamline the inspection process
for fertilization labels. Users capture images of these labels, and the
application automatically populates the inspection form. To achieve this, the
system must accurately read and interpret the information displayed on the
packaging.

# Overview

## What is FertiScan?

FertiScan is a mobile application in development that utilizes Artificial
Intelligence (AI) technology, specifically advanced Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) capabilities. The application's purpose is to simplify and
streamline the process of capturing, extracting, and organizing information on
fertilizer labels. FertiScan aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy with
which inspectors from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) perform these
tasks.

## Key Features

* AI/OCR Technology: Allows scanning of fertilizer labels and extraction of
  essential data.
* Data Storage: Integrates an organized database system for easy access and
  analysis of collected information.
* Verification: Compares and verifies label information against existing company
  profiles.
* Flexibility: Offers integration with other software platforms and
  customization through tailored AI models.

## Why Are We Doing This?

The project aims to:

* Increase accuracy and efficiency: by eliminating or reducing errors and time
  spent in the manual data entry process of labels.
* Improve organizationally: by providing uniformly structured and accessible
  label data storage.
* Facilitate data access and analysis: for quicker and data-informed
  decision-making.
* Conserve resources: to save time and efforts for stakeholders involved in the
  process.
* Regulatory compliance: to reinforce adherence to industry norms and
  regulations.
* Usability: to increase user satisfaction and operational efficiency with a
  practical and easy-to-use application.

## Who Is It For?

FertiScan is primarily intended for inspectors of the CFIA and potentially other
stakeholders in the agricultural sector, such as fertilizer distributors and
manufacturers, as well as regulatory bodies that could benefit from facilitated
access to fertilizing product data.

## How Does It Work?

The FertiScan application would function as follows:

1. Capture: An inspector uses the app to take a photo of the fertilizer labels.
2. Extraction: AI/OCR analyzes the image, extracts relevant textual information,
   and categorizes it.
3. Storage: Extracted data is uploaded into a centralized database.
4. Analysis: The database organizes and makes information easily accessible for
   analysis and review.
5. Verification: The app compares the newly captured information to existing
   data to verify accuracy and to create or update company profiles.

# Overview

## What is FertiScan?

FertiScan is a web application usable on browsers (computer and mobile),
currently under development, which leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI)
technology. This technology includes the use of Optical Character Recognition
(OCR) and advanced language models, enabling high-precision text processing. In
short, FertiScan can "read" OCR results and reformulating this data into a
structured form with predefined fields. The app aims to simplify and streamline
the process of capturing, extracting, organizing, and storing the information
present on fertilizer labels, thereby increasing the efficiency and accuracy of
inspectors from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) in their tasks.

## How to use FertiScan?

## Key Features

* __AI technology and OCR capabilities__: Enables scanning of fertilizer labels
  and extracting essential data.

* __Data storage__: Integrates an organized database system for easy access and
  analysis of collected information.

* __Flexibility__: Offers integration with other software platforms and
  customization through tailored AI models.

## Why are we doing this?

|  | **Improve Operational Excellence** | **Support Service Modernization** | **Improve Stakeholder Experience** |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Challenges** | Inefficiencies in manual data entry and organization of fertilizer label information. | High error rate in manual data entry for label information. | Lack of centralized and structured storage solution for label information. |
| **Opportunities** | <li>**Integrated Data Processing**: Use AI technology to automate the data entry and organization process, reducing manual workload and improving accuracy.</li><li>**Customization for Other Industries**: Extend FertiScan's capabilities to cater to industries beyond fertilizer labels, such as food packaging and product labeling.</li> | <li>**Digital Collaboration**: Develop a platform for stakeholders (inspectors, distributors, manufacturers) to access and fertilizer label data in real-time, improving efficiency.</li><li>**Analytics and Insights**: Leverage the stored data to generate valuable insights and analytics for stakeholders, aiding in decision-making.</li> | <li>**Enhanced Data Accessibility**: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows stakeholders to easily access and retrieve necessary information from the FertiScan database.</li><li>**Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update and enhance FertiScan based on user feedback and evolving needs to ensure a positive stakeholder experience.</li> |

The project aims to:

* __Increase precision and efficiency__: The application ensures the elimination
  of errors and reduces the time spent on the manual data entry process of label
  information.

* __Improve organization__: The information currently collected is dispersed
  within the RDIMS (Records Document and Information Management System) system.
  FertiScan proposes a centralized and structured storage solution, addressing
  one of the main current challenges.

* __Facilitate data access and analysis__: Decision-making is faster and based
  on updated and accurate data.

* __Resource conservation__: To save time and efforts of the stakeholders
  involved in the process.

* __Regulatory compliance__: To reinforce adherence to current standards and
  regulations in the sector.

* __Usability__: To increase user satisfaction and operational efficiency
  through a practical and easy-to-use application.

## Who is FertiScan for?

FertiScan is primarily aimed at CFIA inspectors and potentially other
stakeholders in the agricultural sector, such as fertilizer distributors and
manufacturers, as well as regulatory agencies that could benefit from easier
access to fertilizing product data.

## How does FertiScan work?

The FertiScan application would operate as follows:

1. __Capture__: An inspector uses the app to take photos of fertilizer labels.

2. __Extraction__: The AI analyzes the image and extracts the relevant textual
   information.

3. __Organization__: The extracted data is sorted by labels and validated.

4. __Storage__: The extracted data is uploaded into a centralized database.

Additionally, we are considering the development of a simple interface providing
an overview of the labels stored in the database to facilitate verification and
data updates.

# Overview

## What is Nachet?

The CFIA ensures that seeds or grains crossing Canadian borders meet strict
phytosanitary standards to prevent the spread of invasive weed species. Nachet
Interactive is an open-source web application developed to assist CFIA seed
analysts in identifying regulated weed seeds quickly and accurately. It combines
digital microscopy with computer vision models hosted on AzureML to streamline
the seed inspection process.

Initially focused on weed seed identification, Nachet Interactive's scope is
expanding to include other tasks like identifying pure seeds and insects,
showcasing the application's versatility. This tool aims to support CFIA
scientists by integrating AI into their workflow.

### Seed Species

Currently we are training our models to identify these 15 species:

| | **Species** | |
|:--:|:--:| :--:|
| Ambrosia artemisiifolia  | Ambrosia trifida |  Ambrosia psilostachya |
| Brassica junsea | Brassica napus | Bromus hordeaceus |
| Bromus japonicus | Bromus secalinus | Carduus nutans |
| Cirsium arvense | Cirsium vulgare | Lolium temulentum |
| Solanum carolinense | Solanum nigrum | Solanum rostratum |

## Why are we doing this?

|  | **Improve Operational Excellence** | **Support Service Modernization** | **Improve Stakeholder Experience** |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Challenges** | <li>Lengthy seed inspection process due to manual identification of regulated weed seeds. </li> <li>Large amounts of batches to verify, but very few CFIA seed analysts to do so. </li> | <li>Manual identification of pure seeds and insects leading to time-consuming inspections.</li> <li>For computer vision models to be performant, they need vast amounts of training data, which is a current bottleneck.</li> |  Current process is lengthy, meaning regulated parties have to wait a long time before receiving their phytosanitary certificate. |
| **Opportunities** | <li>**Advanced Identification Models**: Enhance the computer vision models used in Nachet to identify a wider range of regulated weed seeds accurately.</li><li>**Integration with CFIA Workflow**: Integrate Nachet into the CFIA's seed inspection process, reducing time and effort.</li><li>**Cross-functional Expansions**: Extend Nachet's capabilities to identify other seed-related aspects, such as pure seeds and insects. </li> | <li>**Streamline the seed analysis process**: Enabling Nachet to certify seed identification would eliminate the need for multiple lab verifications, significantly reducing time and costs associated with the inspection process. </li> <li>**Real-time Reporting**: Enable automatic reporting capabilities within Nachet, providing instant access to inspection results for internal stakeholders.</li> | <li>**Enhanced Data Accuracy**: Leverage advanced AI models to improve the accuracy of seed identification and provide reliable results for stakeholders.</li> <li>**Quicker turnaround times for exporters:** If smaller labs had the ability to certify the identity of seeds using Nachet, we could prevent many back-and-forths therefore speeding up the phytosanitary certificate emission process. </li> |

# Overview

## What is Finesse?

Finesse is a semantic search engine we are developing. Unlike traditional search
engines that match keywords, semantic search engines understand the intent and
contextual meaning behind a query. Similar to Google and Bing, Finesse allows
users to search for information. However, it searches only within specific
document sets it is provided, not the entire web. The current working prototype,
[finesse.inspection.alpha.canada.ca](https://finesse.inspection.alpha.canada.ca),
is configured to search a set of documents crawled from the public website
[inspection.canada.ca](https://inspection.canada.ca). Our ambition is for
Finesse to be as secure, accurate, and fast as public search engines, while
minimizing costs.

## Key Features

- Semantic Understanding: Provides more accurate search results by understanding
  the intent behind queries, not just the keywords.

- Multi-Language Support: Supports searches in various languages, provided the
  documents are available in those languages.

More features will be added over time.

## Why are we doing this?

|  | **Improve Operational Excellence** | **Support Service Modernization** | **Improve Stakeholder Experience** |
|--|--|--|--|
| **Challenges** | Excessive time wasted by CFIA staff, especially inspectors, in searching for agency-related documents, impacting productivity and efficiency. | Outdated keyword-based internal document search tools. | Inadequate search experience and challenges in finding the right information for CFIA employees. |
| **Opportunities** | <li>**Enhanced Semantic Search**: Further develop Finesse to provide even more accurate search results by understanding the intent and context behind queries.</li><li>**Continuous Expansion**: Increase the range of document sets that can be searched within Finesse, covering various domains beyond the current inspection domain.</li><li>**Integration with Existing Tools**: Integrate Finesse with existing CFIA tools and platforms to provide a seamless and comprehensive search experience for employees.</li> | <li>**Intuitive User Interface**: Design a user-friendly and visually appealing interface for Finesse, ensuring a positive user experience for CFIA employees.</li><li>**Advanced Document Curation**: Develop algorithms that auto-curate and prioritize documents based on relevance, popularity, and accuracy.</li><li>**Multilingual Support**: Expand Finesse's language support to enable searching in languages beyond English and French.</li> | <li>**Improved Search Accuracy**: Provide more accurate and relevant search results through Finesse's advanced semantic understanding and contextual analysis capabilities.</li><li>**Streamlined Information Access**: Develop a streamlined and comprehensive interface that allows CFIA employees to quickly find the right information within internal documents using Finesse.</li><li>**User Training and Support**: Offer training and support resources to assist CFIA employees in effectively utilizing Finesse for their search needs.</li> |

While public search engines like Google and Bing are effective for general web
searches, they do not have access to internal documents. The tools currently
available to CFIA employees for searching internal documents are primarily
keyword-based, which is outdated. Finding the right information is challenging
and often painful for employees. An example of this is the Guidance Finder tool,
accessible at [Guidance Finder](https://inspection.canada.ca/apps/eng/guidance).
In response, we are developing Finesse, a semantic search engine tailored to
efficiently search internal document sets and improve the search experience for
our employees.

## Who is it intended for?

The Finesse search engine is primarily intended for CFIA employees. Currently, a
group of champions—CFIA inspectors—are assisting in testing the prototype.

It is also open source, allowing anyone interested to use the code to develop
their own applications.

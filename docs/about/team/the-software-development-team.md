# The Software development team

### [Kabir, Ibrahim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ibrahimkabir/)

**Hello everyone!** üëã

I am Ibrahim Kabir, a Backend Developer in the Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory team, and my role involves designing and implementing the server-side
logic that powers our AI solutions.

With a degree in electronics, I discovered my passion for computer science.
Being a Backend Developer at CFIA is a way for me to nurture this passion and
continually expand my knowledge.

### [Cardin, Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-cardin/)

Hello, I'm Thomas Cardin, a DevOps Specialist at CFIA. My job is to streamline
software development and deployment to improve system reliability and
efficiency. I'll enforce security to protect our operations and align with SRE
practices to ensure our infrastructure's scalability and continuous service
delivery.

### [Allagbe, Kotchikpa Guy-Landry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guy-landry-allagbe/)

üëã Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts!

I've recently embarked on an exhilarating journey with CFIA's AI Lab as their
newest Backend Developer. Here's a little glimpse into my daily adventures:

Backend Ballet: Seamlessly integrating databases, servers, and all the
behind-the-scenes magic to make our applications sing. API Artistry: Designing,
sculpting, and refining the APIs that fuel our front-end escapades. Efficiency
Engineer: Regularly diving deep to optimize performance, ensuring our apps run
smooth.

For those who know me, you're probably aware of my (borderline obsessive)
passion for all things Python, AI, and the vast realm of the web.

There's a saying that goes: "Love what you do, and you'll never work a day in
your life." Well, I'd tweak that a bit: "Love what you do, especially when it
works!" üòÑ Debugging aside, there's nothing more exhilarating than seeing code
spring to life in perfect harmony.

Curious to connect or dive deeper into my professional odyssey? üßê Feel free to

foster connections and share knowledge!

Cheers to new beginnings and endless lines of code!

### [Lemire, William](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wlemire/)

Hello! My name is William Lemire, and I am a Backend Application Developer in
the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory team.

Before COVID, I worked in the communications/marketing field, holding a
Bachelor's degree in Public Relations from UQAM. As I progressed in my career, I
increasingly realized the impact artificial intelligence (AI) was going to have
in this sector in the coming years. Therefore, I decided to make a switch to
software engineering, eager to be part of this new technological revolution that
is set to transform all areas of society.

Thanks to the AI Laboratory, I have the opportunity to work on exciting projects
that utilize emerging technologies. Additionally, this initiative by the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency demonstrates a commitment to innovation, and
it's an honor to contribute to its mission.

### [Allagbe, Kotchikpa Guy-Landry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guy-landry-allagbe/) - Backend

👋 Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts!

I've recently embarked on an exhilarating journey with CFIA's AI Lab as their
newest Backend Developer. Here's a little glimpse into my daily adventures:

Backend Ballet: Seamlessly integrating databases, servers, and all the
behind-the-scenes magic to make our applications sing. API Artistry: Designing,
sculpting, and refining the APIs that fuel our front-end escapades. Efficiency
Engineer: Regularly diving deep to optimize performance, ensuring our apps run
smooth.

For those who know me, you're probably aware of my (borderline obsessive)
passion for all things Python, AI, and the vast realm of the web.

There's a saying that goes: "Love what you do, and you'll never work a day in
your life." Well, I'd tweak that a bit: "Love what you do, especially when it
works!" 😄 Debugging aside, there's nothing more exhilarating than seeing code
spring to life in perfect harmony.

Curious to connect or dive deeper into my professional odyssey? 🧐 Feel free to

foster connections and share knowledge!

Cheers to new beginnings and endless lines of code!

### [Lemire, William](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wlemire/) - Backend

Hello! My name is William Lemire, and I am a Backend Application Developer in
the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory team.

Before COVID, I worked in the communications/marketing field, holding a
Bachelor's degree in Public Relations from UQAM. As I progressed in my career, I
increasingly realized the impact artificial intelligence (AI) was going to have
in this sector in the coming years. Therefore, I decided to make a switch to
software engineering, eager to be part of this new technological revolution that
is set to transform all areas of society.

Thanks to the AI Laboratory, I have the opportunity to work on exciting projects
that utilize emerging technologies. Additionally, this initiative by the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency demonstrates a commitment to innovation, and
it's an honor to contribute to its mission.

### [Lopez, Jonathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lopez-jonathan/) - DevSecOps

Hi everyone! I'm Jonathan Lopez, currently diving into the world of software
engineering at École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS). I've joined the CFIA AI
Lab DevSecOps team, where I'll be mixing up a special blend of software
development, security, and ops.

My role primarily revolves around the practices of DevOps and Site Reliability
Engineering (SRE), focusing on automating workflows to streamline our processes.
This not only enhances efficiency but also ensures that our path from
development to deployment is as smooth and error-free as possible. I'm
passionate about using modern tools and practices to refine our development
pipeline, reducing the time from concept to product and ensuring high-quality
outputs.

Being part of a team that values innovation and continuous improvement is truly
exciting, and I look forward to making significant contributions to our
projects.

Outside of work, I'm just as passionate about exploring and learning. In my
downtime, I run my own homelab, diving into Kubernetes to enhance my technical
expertise. Feel free to approach me for anything - whether it's project-related
or just to share ideas and insights. I'm here to learn & contribute. 😄

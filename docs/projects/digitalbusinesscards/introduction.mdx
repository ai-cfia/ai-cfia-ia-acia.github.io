# Digital Business Cards

## Overview

Traditional business cards can easily be lost, misplaced, or become obsolete.
Updating contact information manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. The
custom solution of in-house digital business cards is a modern approach to
networking and communication. This project, developed by the Artificial
Intelligence Lab at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), aims to meet the
evolving needs of professionals in the digital age.

## Introduction

Traditional paper-based business cards have limitations in terms of efficiency
and contact management. Our customized digital business cards provide a more
efficient and effective way to manage and exchange contact information
seamlessly, ensuring that it is always up-to-date and easily shareable through
various communication channels.

## Technology Stack

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind), Vue.js
- **Back-end**: JavaScript
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Azure DevOps

## Solution

A static web application hosts the digital business cards, which users can share
through integrated QR codes or direct links.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

<img src={imageone} alt='A screen shot of a phone displaying the business card
of "Doe John" who is a "Business Analyst" at CFIA.' width="400"/>

</div>

### Azure DevOps Integration

Azure DevOps provides a comprehensive set of tools and services for continuous
integration, testing, and deployment automation. The deployment pipeline
encompasses several stages, including:

- **Version Control**: Utilizing Azure Repos for source code management,
  enabling tracking and collaboration.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating the
  build, test, and deployment processes for faster and more reliable releases.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

<img src={imagetwo} alt='QR code to share a business card. The customer can
share their business card by giving the QR code that is linked to the
corresponding business card.' width="400"/>

</div>

### Benefits

1. **Efficient Contact Management**: Simplifies managing contact information,
   ensuring up-to-date and accurate details.
2. **Seamless Networking**: Users can easily share their digital business cards
   through various communication channels, enhancing networking opportunities.
3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: The solution can accommodate a growing
   number of users and adapt to changing business needs.
4. **Reliable Deployment Pipeline**: A dependable deployment pipeline is
   provided by Azure DevOps, ensuring smooth and error-free releases.

## Deliverable

The final outcome of this project is a static web application where digital
business cards are hosted. Clients can share their cards using either the
integrated QR code or a direct link.

### Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Analytics**: Incorporate analytics capabilities to gain insights
  into networking activities and optimize strategies.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Enhance the digital business cards' user
  interface with more interactivity and better visualization effects.
- **Information Management**: Allow users to modify their personal information,
  making the solution more robust and independent.

## Project Status

The project is currently waiting for confirmation on continuation and funding
based on pilot results. If approved, the UI and data manipulation feedback will
be incorporated into the new solution.

### Survey Results

The initial solution was developed quickly due to limited resources. Feedback
primarily focused on improving the UI design and the ability to manipulate
information. Future iterations will aim to design a more CFIA-like UI and
incorporate improvements based on user feedback.

## Code and Repository

The solution developed can be accessed
[here](https://dev.azure.com/CFIA-DevOps-ACIA/AI-Lab/_git/Digital-Business-Card).
It was adapted from [this solution](https://enbizcard.vishnuraghav.com/). The
code repository includes a `ecards-download.py` file that ingests a provided
.csv file with the details for the business card, generates, and downloads them
from the specified website. These are then hosted through an automated CI/CD
pipeline, which can be accessed
[here](https://dev.azure.com/CFIA-DevOps-ACIA/AI-Lab/_build?definitionId=303).

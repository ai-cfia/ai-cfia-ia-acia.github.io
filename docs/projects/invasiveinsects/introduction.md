# Invasive Insects Project

## Overview
At the forefront of agricultural biosecurity, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab) at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) pioneers innovative solutions using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Collaborating with the CFIAâ€™s Plant Health Surveillance Unit and leveraging iNaturalist, the AI Lab has developed tools for species detection and monitoring. These tools, including automated species identification and real-time alert systems, enhance the efficiency and accuracy of CFIA specialists in safeguarding Canada's agricultural landscape.

### Context
Canada is a massive geologically diverse country. For this reason, CFIA mainly conducts surveys that are targeted at specific species or regions, as there are only so many CFIA inspectors. AI proves to be a powerful tool for this challenge.

### Solution
We leverage knowledge of the crowd through the iNaturalist social networking service. This SNS consists of naturalists, citizen scientists, and biologists who share observations of biodiversity across the globe.

We generate weekly comprehensive reports from these crowd-sourced observations to update CFIA inspectors about the spread of invasive insects, plants, and molluscs across North America.

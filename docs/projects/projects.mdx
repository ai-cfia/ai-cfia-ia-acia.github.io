# Projects

Our projects serve as the creative and organizational foundation for developing
our products. They originate from requests or problems identified by CFIA staff.
Projects provide the strategic framework for creating and refining these
solutions, which ultimately become our final products, designed for direct
interaction and user satisfaction.

Here are the projects we are currently working on:

- [Invasive Insects Project](./invasiveinsects/introduction.md)
- [Poultry and Red Meat Condemnations
  Project](./poultryredmeatcond/introduction.md)

- [Fleet Vehicle Management](./fleetdatacmb/introduction.mdx)

# Projects

Our projects serve as a creative and organizational basis for the development of
our products. They can be based on ideas from our team or requests from CFIA
staff.  Projects are the strategic framework that allows us to create and refine
these products, while products are the final product of our innovation, designed
for direct interaction and user satisfaction.

Here are the projects we are currently working on:

- [Invasive Insects Project](./invasiveinsects/introduction.md)
- [Poultry and Red Meat Condemnations
  Project](./poultryredmeatcond/introduction.md)

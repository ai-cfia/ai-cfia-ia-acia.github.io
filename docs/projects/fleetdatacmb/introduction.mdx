# Fleet Vehicle Management

## Overview

The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (AI Lab) at the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA) supports fleet vehicle management by leveraging a customized
storage solution for various datasets related to vehicle expenses, fuel
consumption, recall notices, and telematics. This project uses a Microsoft Azure
storage account to overcome limitations faced with on-premise SharePoint and
Power BI. Migration to SharePoint Online is scheduled for September.

## Introduction

The CFIA's fleet vehicle management team employs Azure storage to store and
organize critical Excel reports, making information easy to access and manage.
This centralized approach improves data monitoring and reporting efficiency,
ensuring fleet data is up-to-date and readily available.

## Storage Structure

The Azure storage account `fleetdatacmb` hosts several types of reports grouped
into specific directories. Here is an overview:

### ARIData

#### ARI Expenses
Contains detailed reports on fixed and operating expenses, categorized by
vehicle, month, type of expense, and vendor. Includes summaries and expense
breakouts by category.

#### ARI Fuel
Provides detailed fuel usage information for vehicles, including
transaction-level data and various summaries and charts regarding fuel expenses
and usage patterns.

#### Recall Notice List
Houses recall notices for vehicles in the fleet, providing details about each
recall's status, description, and the affected vehicles.

### Geotab

#### ARI Extracts
Contains telematics data detailing fleet utilization metrics such as distance
driven, drive and idle times, usage time, and days utilized.

#### Device Status Data
Monitors the communication status of telematic devices in the fleet, indicating
whether devices are active, idle, offline, or not installed.

#### Excel Extracts
Includes various performance metrics for vehicles, such as number of trips,
driving hours, idle hours, and kilometers driven.

### PM Compliance Data
Maintains preventive maintenance (PM) compliance information, tracking due dates
and intervals for scheduled maintenance activities for fleet vehicles.

### SAPData
Contains comprehensive asset management data for the fleet, including asset
descriptions, purchase details, manufacturer data, and location information.

### Vehicle Conditions Data
Tracks the condition and usage of vehicles in the fleet, reporting on metrics
like engine light status, battery alerts, oil life, and excessive idling events.

## Project Status
Currently, the fleet vehicle data is stored in Azure storage accounts. The CFIA
Acquisition and Fleet Management team plans to migrate this data to SharePoint
Online in September to streamline access and improve data management.

## Future Enhancements

- **Enhanced Data Integration**: Once migrated to SharePoint, integrate with
  other CFIA systems for seamless data flow.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Utilize Power BI for more detailed and interactive
  reporting.
- **User Training**: Provide training sessions for staff on using the new
  SharePoint-based system.
